        <p class="dropcap">In 2006, American traveler Blake Mycoskie befriended children in a village in Argentina and found they had no shoes to protect their feet. Wanting to help, he created <em>TOMS</em>, a company that would match every pair of shoes purchased with a pair of new shoes given to a child in need. One for One.

Realizing this movement could serve other basic needs, <em>TOMS</em> Eyewear was launched. With every pair purchased,<em>TOMS</em> will help give sight to a person in need. One for One.</p>
